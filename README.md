 MPI-Parallel and Distributed  Algorithms Laboratory Work-Year 3 Semester 2


These are the laboratory Homeworks for the Parallel and Distributed Algorithms Class

The project follows this tutorial for the installation steps:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW3SKDM_yEs

Because each new project requires a lot of configuring to work, I used only one project in which
every laboratory is commented and can be accessed by uncommenting the 
desired part of the laboratories and commenting the rest of them.
